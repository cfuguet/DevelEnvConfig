	""""""""""""" My cscope/vim key mappings
	"
	" The following maps all invoke one of the following cscope search types:
	"
	"   's'   symbol: find all references to the token under cursor
	"   'g'   global: find global definition(s) of the token under cursor
	"   'c'   calls:  find all calls to the function name under cursor
	"   't'   text:   find all instances of the text under cursor
	"   'e'   egrep:  egrep search for the word under cursor
	"   'f'   file:   open the filename under cursor
	"   'i'   includes: find files that include the filename under cursor
	"   'd'   called: find functions that function under cursor calls
	"
	" Below are three sets of the maps: one set that just jumps to your
	" search result, one that splits the existing vim window horizontally and
	" diplays your search result in the new window, and one that does the same
	" thing, but does a vertical split instead (vim 6 only).
	"
	" I've used CTRL-\ and CTRL-@ as the starting keys for these maps, as it's
	" unlikely that you need their default mappings (CTRL-\'s default use is
	" as part of CTRL-\ CTRL-N typemap, which basically just does the same
	" thing as hitting 'escape': CTRL-@ doesn't seem to have any default use).
	" If you don't like using 'CTRL-@' or CTRL-\, , you can change some or all
	" of these maps to use other keys.  One likely candidate is 'CTRL-_'
	" (which also maps to CTRL-/, which is easier to type).  By default it is
	" used to switch between Hebrew and English keyboard mode.
	"
	" All of the maps involving the <cfile> macro use '^<cfile>$': this is so
	" that searches over '#include <time.h>" return only references to
	" 'time.h', and not 'sys/time.h', etc. (by default cscope will return all
	" files that contain 'time.h' as part of their name).

	" To do the first type of search, hit 'CTRL-\', followed by one of the
	" cscope search types above (s,g,c,t,e,f,i,d).  The result of your cscope
	" search will be displayed in the current window.  You can use CTRL-T to
	" go back to where you were before the search.
